Human and Weapon Detection using CCTV cameras

Used Yolov3, which is a state-of-the-art real-time object detection system. We then used tflite to compress model and deployed it on a Raspberry Pi that was attached to a camera. It collects inferences in real time and is capable of generating occupancy reports and create instant alerts in case of any weapons are detected.
